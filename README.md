# Project Management System (Backend) â€“ Skill Test

Laravel backend implementing:
- Authentication (Sanctum)
- Projects / Tasks / Comments
- Role-based access (admin, manager, user)
- Middleware (request logging)
- Services (TaskAssignmentService)
- Queued notifications (TaskAssigned)
- Caching for project listings
- Factories, Seeders, Feature & Unit tests

## Requirements
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL 8+ (or MariaDB compatible)
- Composer
- Node (optional)
- Redis or File cache (file is fine)
- Mailhog / SMTP (for local mail testing)

## Setup
```bash
composer install

# Configure .env
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
# Set DB_*, QUEUE_CONNECTION=database (or redis), CACHE_DRIVER=file (or redis)
# Set MAIL_* (Mailhog recommended)

# Sanctum & queue tables
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider" --force
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate

# Seed sample data (3 admins, 3 managers, 5 users, 5 projects, 10 tasks, 10 comments)
php artisan db:seed
